# Portfolio
A portfolio of the projects I am currently working on, as well as some completed projects. The works contained within this repository are comprised of personal and professional projects. Becuase of data protection, some of the works here originally contain sensitive information, and so I have replaced it with Lorem.

This portfolio will consist of: web design drafts in photoshop, with the original PSD's as well as PNG's, used as a showcase for the end product. It will also contain the HTML and CSS files of mockups and completed sites. Contained within is also a completely site that I have been involved in during my time on a work placement, at General Motors UK. This required the use of HTML and CSS to manipulate a restricted version of an MS Sharepoint site, that i was tasked to transform from the gerneric sharepoint template, to a branded team site. The files for this project will mostly be basic HTML for the layout. The fucntionality was impletemented with sharepoint features (for access and restriction purposes) but I will provide images of the completed project, with all sensitive information censored.
