# Portfolio
A portfolio of the current projects I am currently working on, As well as some completed projects. Some of the works here originally contain sensitive information, and so I have replaced it with Lorem.

This portfolio will mostly consist of HTML and CSS, as well as some PNG's of front end web design works that I have been involved in during my time on a work placement, at General Motors UK. There are normally multiple versions of the same file which show the progression of the design as more requirements have come in from the business. In the future, I hope to be able to add more projects to this list, as well as some independant works.
